    <h3>The Adventures of Mouse Deer</h3>
    <h1>Mouse Deer and Crocodile</h1>
    <p>One day, Mouse Deer went down to the river. He wanted to take a drink. But he knew Crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him.

        <strong>Deer had an idea.</strong> He said out loud, “I wonder if the water’s warm. I’ll put in my leg and find out.”
        
        But Mouse Deer didn’t put in his leg. Instead, he picked up a stick with his mouth and put in one end.</p>
    <p><strong>Chomp! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater.

        Mouse Deer laughed. “Silly Crocodile! Don’t you know a stick from a leg?”
        
        And he ran off to drink somewhere else!</strong></p>

    <p>Another day, Mouse Deer went back to the river. All he saw there was a floating log. But he knew Crocodile looked like a log when he floated.

        Mouse Deer had an idea. He said out loud, “If that log is really Crocodile, it won’t talk. But if it’s really just a log, it will tell me.”
        
        He listened. A rough voice said, “I’m really just a log.”</p>
    <p>Mouse Deer laughed. “Silly Crocodile! Do you think a log can talk?”
        
        And off he ran again! --></p>
